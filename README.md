Exam Question Format

Each CCA question requires you to solve a particular scenario. In some cases, a tool such as Impala or Hive may be used. In other cases, coding is required. In order to speed up development time of Spark questions, a template may be provided that contains a skeleton of the solution, asking the candidate to fill in the missing lines with functional code. This template will either be written in Scala or written in Python, but not necessarily both.

You are not required to use the template and may solve the scenario using a language you prefer. Be aware, however, that coding every problem from scratch may take more time than is allocated for the exam.

Evaluation, Score Reporting, and Certificate
CCA175 CCA Spark and Hadoop Developer exam questions for preparation

Your exam is graded immediately upon submission and you are e-mailed a score report the same day as your exam. Your score report displays the problem number for each problem you attempted and a grade on that problem. If you fail a problem, the score report includes the criteria you failed (e.g., “Records contain incorrect data” or “Incorrect file format”). We do not report more information in order to protect the exam content.

If you pass the exam, you receive a second e-mail within a few days of your exam with your digital certificate as a PDF, your license number, a Linkedin profile update, and a link to download your CCA logos for use in your personal business collateral and social media profiles.

Required Skills

Data Ingest

The skills to transfer data between external systems and your cluster. This includes the following:

Import data from a MySQL database into HDFS using Sqoop
Export data to a MySQL database from HDFS using Sqoop
Change the delimiter and file format of data during import using Sqoop
Ingest real-time and near-real-time streaming data into HDFS
Process streaming data as it is loaded onto the cluster
Load data into and out of HDFS using the Hadoop File System commands
Transform, Stage, and Store

Convert a set of data values in a given format stored in HDFS into new data values or a new data format and write them into HDFS.

Load RDD data from HDFS for use in Spark applications
Write the results from an RDD back into HDFS using Spark
Read and write files in a variety of file formats
Perform standard extract, transform, load (ETL) processes on data
Data Analysis

Use Spark SQL to interact with the metastore programmatically in your applications. Generate reports by using queries against loaded data.

Use metastore tables as an input source or an output sink for Spark applications
Understand the fundamentals of querying datasets in Spark
Filter data using Spark
Write queries that calculate aggregate statistics
Join disparate datasets using Spark
Produce ranked or sorted data
Code Snippets: will be provided for Pyspark and Scala. You have to edit the snippets accordingly as per the problem statement.

Real Exam Environment: Gateway node will be accessible for execution of the problems during the exam. Keep in mind there will not be any on-screen timer available during the exam. You have to keep asking for the time left. There are three sections for each problem i.e.

Instructions
Data Set
Output Requirements.
Please go through all the three sections carefully before start developing the code.
Note: If you started developing code right after looking at the Instruction part of the question, then later you will realized the exact details of the table like name of the table and HDFS directory are also mentioned. This can waste your time if have to redo the code or might as well cost you a question.
